    "\n",
    "Crime is a critical public safety issue affecting millions of urban residents. Toronto, Canada's largest city with 2.93 million people, faces ongoing challenges in efficiently deploying police resources and designing evidence-based crime prevention policies. Traditional approaches often rely on intuition or reactive responses rather than data-driven insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to analyze Toronto crime data for several compelling reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Public Impact**  \n",
    "Understanding crime patterns directly affects community safety and quality of life for nearly 3 million residents. Every neighborhood, every household, and every individual is potentially impacted by crime or crime prevention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Availability**  \n",
    "Toronto Police Service maintains comprehensive open data dating back to 2014, providing a robust dataset of over 520,000 crime records. This publicly accessible data enables transparent, reproducible research that can be verified and built upon by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timely Relevance**  \n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic created a natural experiment, allowing us to observe how major societal disruptions affect crime patterns. Understanding these changes is crucial for adapting police strategies to a post-pandemic world where some behaviors have permanently changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actionable Outcomes**  \n",
    "Unlike purely academic research, our analysis can directly inform police deployment strategies and policy decisions. The insights we generate have real-world applications for public safety that can be implemented immediately.\n",

    "## 1.2 Why This Is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategic Resource Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "Police services operate with constrained budgets and limited personnel. A 2023 Toronto Police Service report shows the force employs approximately 5,500 officers to serve 2.93 million residents—roughly 1 officer per 533 residents. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color: #e7f3ff; border-left: 4px solid #0066cc; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0;\">\n",
    "<strong>Key Insight:</strong> Crime is not uniformly distributed. The top 5 neighborhoods account for 15% of all crime, and the midnight hour accounts for 6.9% of daily crimes. This concentration means targeted deployment can have disproportionate impact.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evidence-Based Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Crime prevention policies should be grounded in empirical data rather than anecdotal evidence or political pressure. Our analysis examines correlations between socioeconomic factors (income, unemployment, poverty) and crime rates, providing evidence for policy discussions about whether economic interventions complement traditional policing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we found that higher unemployment correlates with higher crime (r = +0.38, p < 0.001). While this doesn't prove causation, it suggests that job creation programs in high-crime neighborhoods might be worth piloting and evaluating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding COVID's Lasting Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandemic disrupted society in unprecedented ways—lockdowns, work-from-home mandates, business closures, and economic stress. Understanding which crime changes are temporary versus permanent helps police and policymakers adapt strategies for the \"new normal.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color: #f0fff0; border: 2px solid #28a745; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0; border-radius: 5px;\">\n",
    "<strong>Major Finding:</strong> Auto theft increased 58% post-COVID and shows no signs of recovery, while break & enter decreased 41% and remains low. These are structural shifts requiring strategic response, not temporary fluctuations.\n",

    "### Primary Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1: Temporal Patterns - When do crimes occur?**\n",
    "- Which hour of day has the most crime?\n",
    "- Which day of week has the most crime?\n",
    "- Which season has the most crime?\n",
    "- How have crime rates changed over the 11-year period?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: Spatial Patterns - Where do crimes concentrate?**\n",
    "- Which neighborhoods are crime hotspots?\n",
    "- How concentrated is crime (do a few areas account for most crime)?\n",
    "- Which neighborhoods are \"emerging hotspots\" (getting worse over time)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3: COVID-19 Impact - How did the pandemic change crime?**\n",
    "- Did overall crime increase or decrease during COVID?\n",
    "- Which crime types were affected most?\n",
    "- Are changes temporary or permanent (post-COVID comparison)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4: Socioeconomic Factors - Do economic conditions correlate with crime?**\n",
    "- Does income correlate with crime rates?\n",
    "- Does unemployment correlate with crime rates?\n",
    "- Does poverty correlate with crime rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5: Per Capita Comparison - Does population adjustment matter?**\n",
    "- What are crime rates per 1,000 population (not just total crimes)?\n",
    "- Do neighborhood rankings change when adjusted for population?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6: Technology Vulnerability - Why did auto theft surge?**\n",
    "- What external factors explain the dramatic auto theft increase?\n",
    "- Is this related to vehicle technology changes?\n",

    "### Why We Chose This Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Comprehensive Coverage**  \n",
    "   Unlike many crime datasets that focus on specific crime types or limited time periods, Toronto's MCI data includes all major crimes over 11+ years. This breadth enables both cross-sectional (comparing crime types) and longitudinal (tracking changes over time) analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Temporal Granularity**  \n",
    "   The dataset includes not just dates but specific hours, allowing us to identify daily patterns (midnight peak) that wouldn't be visible with date-only data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Geographic Precision**  \n",
    "   With both coordinates (exact location) and neighborhood assignments, we can analyze crime at multiple spatial scales—from specific street corners to citywide patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reliability**  \n",
    "   Official police data represents actual reported crimes, not estimates or surveys. While under-reporting is a limitation (discussed in Section 4), the data we have is authoritative.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Public Accessibility**  \n",
    "   Open data enables transparent, reproducible research. Anyone can download the same dataset and verify our findings.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Anthony Opoku - Temporal Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I Learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Skills:**\n",
    "1. **SQL Proficiency:** Became comfortable with complex aggregations (GROUP BY hour/day/season), CASE statements for conditional aggregation, and date functions. Example challenge: Calculating year-over-year changes required careful date arithmetic and window functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning is Critical:** Spent approximately 30% of total project time on cleaning. Initially felt excessive, but proved essential. Discovered missing data patterns revealed data quality improvements over time. Learned to document every cleaning decision for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualization Best Practices:**\n",
    "   - Bar charts for categorical comparisons (days of week, crime types)\n",
    "   - Line charts for trends over time (yearly changes)\n",
    "   - Heatmaps for two-dimensional patterns (crime type × hour)\n",
    "   - Color coding matters enormously: Red/green intuitive for high/low\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Statistical Thinking:** Percentages more meaningful than raw counts for communication, understanding trend significance vs. random variation, importance of stating sample sizes and time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conceptual Insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our temporal findings strongly support Cohen & Felson's (1979) routine activity theory. Crime peaks when motivated offenders are present (Friday night), suitable targets available (midnight - people leaving bars intoxicated), and guardianship absent (late night, fewer police, people less vigilant).\n",
    "\n",
    "COVID created a natural experiment showing how lockdowns, work-from-home, and economic stress compete to shape crime patterns. This taught me more about crime causation than any textbook could.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technologies I'd Choose Differently:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Would Use:**\n",
    "- Tableau or Power BI for interactive dashboards instead of static matplotlib charts\n",
    "  - Reason: Stakeholders want to filter/explore data themselves\n",
    "  - Current approach: SQL + Python + manual chart creation = labor-intensive\n",
    "\n",
    "**Would Keep:**\n",
    "- Jupyter notebooks for analysis documentation and reproducibility\n",
    "- Python pandas for data manipulation (flexible, powerful)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Would Add:**\n",
    "- Automated testing to check data quality each time dataset updates\n",
    "- Git version control from day one (we started 3 weeks in, lost some work)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How I'd Extend This:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short-term (2 more months):**\n",
    "1. Add weather data (temperature, precipitation) to test if crime varies by weather, not just season\n",
    "2. Hour × Day interaction analysis (are Friday midnight patterns different from Tuesday midnight?)\n",
    "3. Build predictive model: Given day/hour/weather → predict crime volume for staffing optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long-term (thesis level):**\n",
    "1. Causal inference using difference-in-differences\n",
    "2. Compare to other cities (universal patterns or Toronto-specific?)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cynthia Onwumere - Spatial Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I Learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Skills:**\n",
    "1. **Geographic Data Complexity:** Working with GeoJSON, coordinate systems, and spatial joins was entirely new. EPSG:4326 (WGS84) vs. other projections - learned why coordinate systems matter. Using wrong CRS can put Toronto in the ocean!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mapping Libraries:**\n",
    "   - **geopandas:** Powerful but steep learning curve (2 weeks to feel comfortable)\n",
    "   - **folium:** Easier for interactive maps, limited customization\n",
    "   - **matplotlib:** Good for static publication-quality maps, full control\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Per Capita Insight - Biggest \"Aha Moment\":** Seeing Waterfront drop from #1 to #8 when population-adjusted was transformative. Taught me to always ask \"per what?\" when looking at counts. This lesson applies beyond crime: economic indicators (GDP per capita), health metrics (cases per 100,000), education (students per teacher).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Name Matching Challenges:** Regular expressions became essential. Multiple variations (\"St. James Town\" vs \"St James Town\"), numbers in parentheses, unicode issues all required careful handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conceptual Insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our spatial findings support Brantingham & Brantingham's (1993) crime pattern theory: crime concentrates where offenders' awareness spaces overlap with target-rich environments. Downtown fits perfectly—offenders know the area (transit accessible) and targets are abundant (people, businesses).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Population adjustment is not optional—it's fundamental.** This is the most important lesson from the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technologies I'd Choose Differently:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Would Use:**\n",
    "- PostGIS (spatial database) instead of Python spatial joins for large datasets—much faster\n",
    "- QGIS for exploratory analysis before coding to visualize data quality issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Would Keep:**\n",
    "- Python for automation and reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "**How I'd Extend This:**\n",
    "1. Spatial clustering analysis (Moran's I statistic) to test if crime truly concentrated or just following population\n",
    "2. Distance to transit: calculate each crime's distance to nearest TTC station\n",
    "3. Time-animated maps showing how hotspots move throughout the day\n",
    "4. 3D visualization with height = crime rate (see \"peaks and valleys\" across city)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Olusola Akinola - COVID Impact Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I Learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Skills:**\n",
    "1. **Before/After Analysis Design:** Defining periods carefully matters. Used annual averages to smooth seasonal variation. Deciding what counts as \"COVID period\" subjective but important.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Permanent vs. Temporary Changes:** Expected all crimes to \"bounce back\" post-COVID. Surprised that auto theft CONTINUED RISING and break & enter STAYED LOW. Learned to look for structural explanations (technology, behavior change) not just temporary shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Crime Type Differences:** Each crime has different opportunity structure. Break & enter needs empty houses → WFH kills it. Auto theft exploits technology → vulnerability remains → crime stays high. Assault needs human interaction → recovers when people socialize again.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Storytelling:** Numbers alone don't convince - need narrative. \"Auto theft +58%\" less impactful than explaining professional criminals adapted to empty streets, established export networks, and continue operating.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conceptual Insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "COVID wasn't just a temporary shock—it fundamentally restructured the crime landscape. Work-from-home didn't end when lockdowns lifted; many companies kept hybrid policies. Relay attack knowledge didn't disappear; criminal networks remained operational. Cashless payment acceleration was one-way; we're not going back to carrying cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights taught me that major societal disruptions don't just pause normal patterns—they can create new equilibria. Policymakers waiting for \"return to normal\" will be disappointed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technologies I'd Choose Differently:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Would Use:**\n",
    "- Time series analysis libraries (statsmodels) for proper trend decomposition and forecasting\n",
    "- Interrupted time series analysis (statistical test for COVID impact significance)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Would Keep:**\n",
    "- Comparative approach (before/after) - simple and interpretable\n",
    "\n",
    "**How I'd Extend This:**\n",
    "1. Longer post-COVID period (currently only 3 years; wait 2-3 more to confirm permanence)\n",
    "2. Compare to other cities (is Toronto's pattern unique or did Vancouver, Montreal see same changes?)\n",
    "3. Mechanism testing: Find data on WFH rates by neighborhood - does it predict break & enter decline?\n",
    "4. Policy evaluation: When automakers fix keyless entry, will auto theft drop? Track this.\n",

    "- Weekly meetings to discuss blockers\n",
    "- Share findings and brainstorm interpretations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation:**\n",
    "- Well-commented code made integration easier\n",
    "- Future teams (or future us) can understand decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Was Challenging\n",
    "\n",
    "**Different Skill Levels:**\n",
    "- Some team members more experienced with Python/SQL than others\n",
    "- **Solution:** Pair programming sessions where experienced members taught others\n",
    "- Result: Everyone's skills improved\n",
    "\n",
    "**Merge Conflicts:**\n",
    "- Multiple people editing same notebooks created issues\n",
    "- **Solution:** Modular structure (separate notebooks for each analysis)\n",
    "- Result: Clean integration without overwriting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inconsistent Naming:**\n",
    "- Early code used different variable names for same concepts\n",
    "- **Solution:** Created style guide (always `Neighbourhood_Clean`, never `neighborhood` or `hood_name`)\n",
    "- Result: Readable, maintainable code\n",

    "## 4.3 What We Would Do Differently\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Start with Per Capita from Day One\n",
    "\n",
    "We spent weeks analyzing raw crime counts before someone suggested population adjustment. This was backwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Better approach:**\n",
    "- First analysis: Calculate per-capita rates\n",
    "- Then: Dig into raw counts for specific questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson:** Question assumptions early. \"High crime\" is ambiguous without defining per capita vs. total.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Automate Data Quality Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "We manually checked for missing data, outliers, inconsistencies. Should have written automated tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_data_quality(df):\n",
    "    assert df['OCC_YEAR'].between(2014, 2025).all(), \"Invalid years detected\"\n",

    "    # etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "test_data_quality(df)  # Run every time data loads\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefit:** Catch errors immediately, not weeks later.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Version Control from Start\n",
    "\n",
    "We started using GitHub 3 weeks into project. Lost some early work due to overwriting files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson:** Initialize git repo on day one, commit frequently with meaningful messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Peer Code Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially everyone coded independently. Later implemented mandatory code review before merging.\n",

    "<strong>Most Important Finding:</strong> Rather than a temporary disruption, COVID created lasting changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><strong>Auto Theft: +58%</strong> and still rising (technology vulnerabilities + organized crime networks)</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>Break & Enter: -41%</strong> and staying low (work-from-home + smart home technology)</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>Robbery: -23%</strong> and declining (cashless society acceleration)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</div>\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Per Capita Adjustment Revealed Hidden Hotspots\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw crime counts are misleading. Population adjustment completely changed our understanding:\n",

    "- **Waterfront Communities:** #1 raw counts → #8 per capita\n",
    "- **West Queen West:** #4 raw counts → #1 per capita (67.1 per 1,000)\n",
    "- **Small neighborhoods** like Moss Park (#3) and Regent Park (#4) revealed as high-risk\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy Implication:** Small high-rate neighborhoods need intensive intervention despite lower total crime volume. Resources should be allocated by RISK PER PERSON, not just volume.\n",

    "### Analysis Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No victim/offender demographics:** Can't analyze by age, gender, race\n",
    "2. **No vehicle make/model:** Can't confirm specific cars targeted (had to use external sources)\n",
    "3. **No weather data:** Can't separate seasonal vs. temperature effects\n",
    "4. **Under-reporting bias:** Assault findings especially affected\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Correlation ≠ Causation:** Cannot prove poverty causes crime\n",

    "Crime affects millions of Torontonians daily. Data-driven approaches can make cities safer by helping police deploy resources efficiently and policymakers design evidence-based interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis showed:\n",
    "- **COVID permanently changed crime patterns** (police must adapt)\n",
    "- **Per capita rates reveal true risk** (small neighborhoods need attention)\n",
    "- **Crime is predictable** (time/place patterns allow prevention)\n",
    "- **Economic factors matter** (holistic approach needed)\n",
    "- **Technology vulnerabilities are exploited** (requires multi-stakeholder response)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most importantly:** We demonstrated that open data, rigorous analysis, and transparent reporting can inform public safety decisions affecting millions of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The work doesn't end here.** As new data becomes available, analyses should update. As interventions are implemented, effectiveness should be evaluated. As crime evolves, research must adapt.\n",
